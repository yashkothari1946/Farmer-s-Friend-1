This repository is having files of Farmer's Friend Mobile Application.

## About
Our project is all about helping farmers using Digital Technologies and making their daily work easier.
Farmer's Mark is a mobile application which uses Digital Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Data Analysis, IOT, etc. to help farmers.
The main idea behind this application is to facilitate farmers with such an application which will not only help them do better Crop Management but also know the current status of their crops. Using these application farmers can know more about their crops using Visual Recognition Feature of the application and they can also check the current market rates and MSP of the Crops.

## Technology Stack
The Major Technologies used by this application are:
    * Android
    * Php
    * IBM Cloud
    * Augmented Reality(A.R.)
    * Data APIs
    * Google APIs
These are the major technologies. however, there are some more technologies used at the backend to provide additional functionalities.


## Working of Functionalities
  
  ### Crop Health Monitoring
      - This feature uses Visual Recognition to detect the features of crop plant then it analyzes the visual information to know about plant's health.
      - This analyzed information is displayed as a 3-D Augmented Reality Visualization surrounding the Plant.
      
  ### Crop Yield Management
      - This feature takes the complete information of the crop such as Soil-Type, Cultivation Area, Crop Type, etc. from the farmer using the mobile application.
      - Based on the information it does the calculations using some algorithms to predict the requirement of components such as Water and Fertilizers for the respective crop-conditions.
      
  ### Fertilizer Recommendation
      - This feature uses Visual Recognition to detect and identify the Crop.
      - It searches for the recommended fertilizers for that particular crop from a Centralized Database.
      - It not only recommends the fertilizers but also gives us the information about the nearby dealers who supply the fertilizer.
      
  ### Current Market Report
      - This feature shows a market report including the Minimum Support Price(MSP) and the current market rates of various corps.
      - This also predicts the rise and fall in the prices of the crop in near future, which helps farmers to take better decisions.
